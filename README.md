# Lorenz-Attractor

This is a visualisation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system">lorenz attractor</a> being generated. This was my submission in the 'Fine and Digital Arts' course that I took at university. This is made in the python mode of <a href="https://www.processing.org">processing</a>, a graphics library. How to run this file can be found <a href="https://py.processing.org/tutorials/command-line/">here</a>.
